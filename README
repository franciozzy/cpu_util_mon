 Description
 -----------
  This program continuously reads the CPU statistics from /proc/stats and
  reports a 'cum_t' struct via a shared memory file. By default, this is
  updated every second and can be read by mmap()ing the file.

  The 'example.c' provided code demonstrates how to read the shared file.


 Compiling

 TODOs

  * Accept some command line parameters to override the defaults
  * Daemonise properly by itself
  * Provide some init-friendly scripts with the package
